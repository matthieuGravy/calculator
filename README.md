# JavaScript Calculator Overview

This directory contains a JavaScript calculator. It operates using both the keyboard and visual keys. My primary intent was to enable arithmetic calculations to be carried out without clicking, solely utilizing the keyboard keys.

<br />

## Functionality Details

I significantly complicated a project by creating 4 divs with the purpose of appearing and disappearing. You input the first term, then press the operator to proceed with the second term. Finally, by pressing "Enter" or the equal sign, you obtain the result.
